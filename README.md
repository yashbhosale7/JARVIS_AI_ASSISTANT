# JARVIS_AI_ASSISTANT
An AI assistant for your own Computer/Laptop using libraries in python which can execute certain tasks for you on your voice command.
I have designed it to be active for as long as you don't turn it off and unless you call out it's specifeid name , it'll not recognize your commands so you can leave it open freely.
It can even perform tasks on your web browser with the help of webbrowser library in python and you can easily customize it to do more taks on it.
It uses pyttsx3 library for text to speech recognition an goole_speech for clear voice input and recognition.
I have given it Google Gemini API key too , so if you ask him any question other than commands , he gets a reply from Gemini AI and speaks to you and you can customize it for OPENAI API key too.
Enjoy with your personal assistant. :)
